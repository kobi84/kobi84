My name is Tomasz Kobiela and I am Fronted Developer from Poland.  
I started my career in company selling commercial version of Linux distribution.  
I was responsible for maintaining it and create graphical tools for this distribution.  
After few years I moved to Frontend and decided to develop in this area.  
Currently I am working with Angular.
